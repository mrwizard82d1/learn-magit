# Introduction 

A set of utilities to support test-driven development.

## Overview

When creating unit tests, developers need data that is **not** critical to the test. As Brian Marick says, if we need data that is not critical, arbitrary data is most likely to uncover an error in our code. These utilities support generating this arbitrary data.

For now, I think that the core module will contain the most basic code: Generating random

* Integers
* Floating-point numbers
* Characters 
* Dates

# Getting Started

TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references


# Build and Test

Build your project once in dev mode with the following script and then open `index.html` in your browser.

    ./scripts/build

To auto build your project in dev mode:

    ./script/watch

To start an auto-building Node REPL (requires
[rlwrap](http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/uck/rlwrap/), on OS X
installable via brew):

    ./scripts/repl

To get source map support in the Node REPL:

    lein npm install

To start a browser REPL:

1. Uncomment the following lines in src/test_utils_cljs/core.cljs:
```clojure
;; (defonce conn
;;   (repl/connect "http://localhost:9000/repl"))
```
2. Run `./scripts/brepl`
3. Browse to `http://localhost:9000` (you should see `Hello world!` in the web console)
4. (back to step 3) you should now see the REPL prompt: `cljs.user=>`
5. You may now evaluate ClojureScript statements in the browser context.

For more info using the browser as a REPL environment, see
[this](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/The-REPL-and-Evaluation-Environments#browser-as-evaluation-environment).

Clean project specific out:

    lein clean

Build a single release artifact with the following script and then open `index_release.html` in your browser.

    ./scripts/release

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
